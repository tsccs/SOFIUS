'0.30 = New Name=Server Open File In-Use Search (SOFIUS). App icon created with xiconeditor.com
'0.30 = New INI section, [Remove]. Common text to remove from results. Build public Array. Change FindReplace() to [for each] loop.
'0.30 = Added File Menu at the top. Need to try and fix allignment.
'0.31 = Fix Favorites, if blank, don't show. If group is blank, don't show. Impliment EditINI and ReReadINI.
'		Add TabIndex to align [Tab] use to each column of servers. Add lots program comments. Added Keyboard shortcut keys.
'0.32 = Add more comments. Added Ctrl and Alt Keyboard Shortcut Keys.
'		Added SkipGroup Function to INI proccessor. [-GroupName].
'		Better Group Header Name Proccessing. Allow # comments in-line in INI file.
'		Add option to sort output data. Will need to sort each section and combine into final output file.
'			Sort by path will require Split() to sort by second column. Code will always sort by path.
'		Add INI options to sort by name. [Settings] SortByName=0/1
'0.33 = Add AccountUsername to INI. If username exists, show password input box below [Search] button, and increase windows size by one.
'0.33 = Program now working when run from a UNC path. It will localize to the current folder, no matter where, and create/load the INI and LogFileViewer from there.

'0.xx = Search for '.' on ReadyNAS can result in "INFO: No shared open files found." which causes "Subscript Out of Range" error. Need to fix. (Idea: Look for comma. If none found, skip that line.)
'0.xx = Need to Close Popup Menus (File, Edit, Help...) when clicking somewhere else in the app.

'0.xx = TODO, Add INI options for 'RemoveColumns'
'		'RemoveColumns', might need to be in each group, depending on the results from OpenFiles on a particular server.
'				Will likely need to program into current BubbleSort. May also need it's own BubbleSort to sort removed multiple columns from high to low.
'				Expected columns to remove, 1 and 3. Must remove 3 first, otherwise removing column 1 will make column 3 move to column 2.
'				Maybe do an "if column exists in Array(RemoveColumns) then don't output to final results file."
'0.xx = TODO, Add error catch each time the server search is run.
'0.xx = TODO, Add timeout for when a server search is taking too long. (objShell.Run)
'0.xx = TODO, Add INI option to keep the output results. Must always delete that file, if it exists, before a new [Search] run. Note: Others could use this to look for other in-use files. May not be necessary.
'0.xx = TODO, Implement Error Handling, especially at file open levels (for access denied permission issues) and INI import issues.
'0.xx = TODO, Test/Change OPENFILES to use VBS Internal Server File In-Use Lookup. Test Speed. Can't get it working yet. Memory Overflow.
